        Dear Recruitment Team,
        I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineering role at Microsoft. As a Bachelor
        of Technology candidate at Shiv Nadar University with a major in Computer Science Engineering, I am
        eager to bring my technical expertise and passion for innovation to a company that values growth,
        excellence, and diversity.
        Previously, I wasshortlisted for the Microsoft Engage Intern Program for my project on ASLR with hand
        gesture recognition, I have experienced Microsoft's inspiring culture firsthand. Although I did not get
        the opportunity to intern due to the role being filled, the technical and HR interviews I went through
        reinforced my aspiration to contribute to Microsoft's mission.
        My recent internship as a Front-End Developer Intern at Celebal Technologies equipped me with
        hands-on experience in creating responsive and user-friendly applications. I have a solid foundation in
        coding with languages such as Java, C/C++, and JavaScript, and a practical understanding of data
        structures, algorithms, and operating systems.
        I am drawn to the Microsoft Aspire Experience, as it aligns with my commitment to lifelong learning
        and professional development. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to grow within Microsoftâ€™s
        innovative environment, and I am confident that my background in creating impactful technology
        solutions will make a significant contribution to your team.
        Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to further discuss
        how my skills and experiences align with the goals of Microsoft.
        Warm regards,
        Sincerely,
        [name]
